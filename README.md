# OnionGuard: Storage & Rot Detection  
A real-time monitoring system designed to detect onion rotting and regulate environmental conditions in storage facilities, helping prevent spoilage and reduce losses.<br>

**Programmed In:** C  
**Utilises:**  
- MQ137 (Ammonia Sensor)  
- DHT11 (Temperature & Humidity Sensor)  
- L293D (Motor Controller)  
- Arduino – *Microcontroller that runs embedded logic to detect spoilage and control ventilation based on sensor readings.*


### Key Accomplishments
- Researched and designed an innovative spoilage detection system  
- Implemented custom logic for MQ137 using its datasheet (no official library available)  
- Integrated sensors and motor controller into a cohesive system
